        <p>So i will be testing Git with this code.</p>
        <p>I'm adding this pararagraph as a test.</p>
        <p>I succesfully learned how to add the file by using: git add.</p>
        <p>Then i learned how to commit the file by running: git commit -m "example text"</p>
        <p>This is an alternate branch, so you shouldn't see this on the main one!</p>
